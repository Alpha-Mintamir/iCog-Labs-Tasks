# iCog-Labs-Tasks
 
Welcome to the iCog-Labs Tasks repository! This repository contains all the tasks I have completed during my internship at iCog-Labs, organized on a weekly basis.

## Folder Structure

Each week has its own folder, named as follows:
- `Week 1`
- `Week 2`
- `Week 3`
- ...

Inside each week's folder, you will find:
- A `README.md` file with a summary of the tasks completed that week.
- Additional files and resources related to the tasks.

## How to Navigate

To view the tasks for a specific week, simply navigate to the corresponding folder. Each `README.md` file will provide detailed information about the tasks and any relevant notes or instructions.

## Contact

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
